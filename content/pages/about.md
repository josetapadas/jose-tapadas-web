I've graduated as a MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering (major: Telecommunication Systems, minor: Computer Science) at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), Lisbon.

My majoring focused mostly on signal processing and propagation. Culminating with the study and analysis of the electromagnetic phenomena in media with negative permeability and permittivity and all the theoretical inferance on how media with such characteristcs lead into some physical effects.

Developed full integration tests using RSpec and Capybara-Poltergeist + PhantomJS stack on the whole E2E platform.

I’ve also developed the second version of the [CustoJusto’s Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schibsted.iberica.custojusto&hl=en) as well as a generic caching library for the Android app that was then integrated on multiple Schibsted Android applications.
