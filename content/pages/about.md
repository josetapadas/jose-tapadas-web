Graduated as a MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering (major: Telecommunication Systems, minor: Computer Science) at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), Lisbon.

My majoring focused mostly on signal processing and propagation. Culminating with the study and analysis of the electromagnetic phenomena in media with negative permeability and permittivity and all the theoretical inferance on how media with such characteristcs lead into some physical effects.

### past work

#### *october 2014 - december 2017: Runtime Revolution*

![](/media/rr.png)

My main role at [Runtime Revolution](https://www.runtime-revolution.com/) was to develop custom tailored platforms matching the customers’ needs.

Heavily worked as the interface with customers since day one, gathering specs, planningand developing those applications. My role also involved building, managing and working with small to medium teams of developers. Was also part of the staffing and recruiting team, helping as well on the technical education and integration of junior developers.

The main development stack is ReactJS, TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, Python, React Native and AngularJS.

Some of the projects I've developed may be showcased at:
- [Cribdilla](https://www.cribdilla.com) *[NodeJS, ReactJS, WebRTC, Django]*
- [Shermans Cruise](https://www.shermanscruise.com/) *[RoR, ReactJS, ElasticSearch, Chef, Redis, AWS, MySQL]*
- [Clark](https://www.hiclark.com/blog/introducing-clark-3) *[React Native]*
- [My Lola](https://www.mylola.com/) *[RoR, AngularJS, PostgreSQL]*
- [Grand Central Optical](https://www.grandcentraloptical.com/woman-optical) *[RoR]*

#### *september 2012 - october 2014: Schibsted Media Group*

![](/media/cs.jpg)

Worked as a full stack developer for two teams at [Schibsted](https://schibsted.com/): mostly on the [CustoJusto](https://www.custojusto.pt) website (and Android application) but also on both the core logic shared by Shibsted teams (tutti.ch, blocket.se, ...) and the shared logic for the Android applications.

The frontend used twitter’s Bootstrap, an in-house platform with C templates that generated HTML, it used jQuery and standard SASS stylesheets and mixins. 

On the backend we developed on a C transaction server, specific Apache modules, some PHP applications and some logic within PostgreSQL stored procedures. A Redis server side integration was also used for some features.

Developed full integration tests using RSpec alongside with the Capybara-Poltergeist + PhantomJS stack. 

Developed some custom gems containing daemon clients, configuration files, parsers, database helpers, custom factories, ... to instantiate ruby objects than could beused on our testing. This project was then integrated on the current core set of the Shibsted shared “blocket.se” platform. 

We had a RoR (non-ActiveRecord-ish) RESTful API that used plain ruby objects (with ActiveAttr). Some specific models also subclassed SuperModel for querying and serialisation.

Developed the new responsive website and refactored the stylesheet bundles fully with SASS.

I’ve also developed, remotely on a global Schibsted team, the second version of the [CustoJusto’s Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.schibsted.iberica.custojusto&hl=en).
