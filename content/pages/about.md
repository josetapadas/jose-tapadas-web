MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering (major: Telecommunication Systems, minor: Computer Science) at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), Lisbon.

Majoring thesis consisted on the study and analysis of the electromagnetic phenomena in media with negative permeability and permittivity. The theoretical inferance on how media with such characteristcs lead into some physical phenomena such as the appearance of backward waves and the emergence and implications of negative refraction:
